<h1>Rules</h1>
<ul>
<li>At the start of every game, each user is dealt two cards from the deck in order from left to right of the table.</li>
<li>The dealer is also dealt two cards at the start of every game, except the dealer's first card is hidden from the user (known as the hole card) and the second card is visible to the user (known as the upcard).</li>
<li>Once every player has been dealt along with the dealer, the game begins. Each player has their turn in order from left to right.</li>
<li>Sticking on the hand means that hand has been played and it moves on to the next hand/player.</li>
<li>A player can stick on their hand at any time when the hand is still in play and it is their turn.</li>
<li>Hitting on the hand adds the next card from the deck.</li>
<li>A player can hit on their hand while the minimum value of the hand is less than 21.</li>
<li>Doubling down on the hand doubles the players bet, adds the next card from the deck then sticks on that hand.</li>
<li>A player can double down on their hand while the minimum value of the hand is less than 21 and it is their first turn on that hand.</li>
<li>A player can split their hand when they have only two cards in their hand, they are the same rank and the hand that is to be split does not derive from a split hand. Once split, the player now has two hands with each hand's first card having the same rank and suit as the two identical cards in the previous hand.</li>
<li>Once every player has played their hands, the dealer begins its turn.</li>
<li>The dealer must hit on their hand until the lowest value of its hand is greater than 16.</li>
</ul>
